                            <p> I play on my xbox but I can play on my pc and this looks kinda So I decided with a few friends to start playing an MMO again, and currently we all agreed to play BDO. Looks pretty amazing, but then i see reviewers say that it's heavily p2w and is also a grindfest. But part of me feels that its exaggerated because those are cons that are present in every MMO out there right? Im fine with the game not being completely f2p because i have to purchase it to play anyways so i dont mind spending a little more occasionally (Wouldn't like a major cash drain though). Hi, I was told I can use Softether VPN to play NA Black Desert online with my friends but now when I login the game then turn off the VPN it will automatically log me out??? Am I the only one have this kind of problem. You always hear about how you can play these games as normal or focusing entirely on life skills and while the prospect of what's essentially a fantasy life simulator interests me, I'm really curious as to what it actually means to play like that. Is the crafting and gathering that profound ? Is it actually possible to play while rarely ever entering combat ? What's it all entail. So for the past month my windows 7 PC has this weird thing going on where every time at XX:59 (1 minute before the next hour) i get a really weird sound effect that gets played. It sounds like a typical Windows sound effect, but going through Windows sounds I cannot find it, so I'm not sure if it's a legitimate sound effect. I downloaded Malwarebytes and Adware Cleaner, and I also ran Microsoft Security Essentials. It detected the Trovi adware, which is commonly associated with Google Chrome So I am getting sick to death of WoW. Been playing for 13 years and the devs are destroying the game with every stupid decision they can think of. I'm ready to move on, but to what? I like how BD looks, watched a few videos but I have a few questions: 1. Is it pay to win or plagued with in game transactions? 2. Is the PvP heavily in favor of melee? 3. Do I have to play a female toon if I role a certain class or is gender a choice and not class specific? 4. Are the devs open to player sugges. 
I have never played an mmo before in my life so was just wondering how this all worked are there literally thousands of people on the same game world Hey guys. I consider myself a Stoner noob. Throughout my life I used to listen to a lot of Classic Rock (Pink Floyd, Zeppelin, Hendrix etc), then I was all over NuMetal (happy 2000's :)) and these days I'm floating around a lot of things (Mainly old stuff that I like and new Indie Rock, Alternative etc). Don't really remember how, but lately Spotify introduced me to a Stoner Rock song, I think it was by Sleep. Those riffs, big sound and overall power sucked me in. I joined this sub lately. Greetings! After not playing BDO for more than a year and a half, I returned few days ago (god bless new pc) and needless to say, my guild is more than dead and it isn't the best feeling when you play alone. I'm currently looking for a new guild and people to play with, so if you're by any chance playing BDO please do hit me up! I'm chilled and quiet, most of the time shy person, but I can stand my ground and don't tolerate others bullsh. 
I think it is time to inform us about the current state of the game. How far is the development? What is still missing? ? Now that Elder Scrolls: Blades is on its way to becoming the official release, there is nearly no game in the mobile sector to counteract its success. It would be useful to draw attention to Diablo. What do you think about it? Sorry for my mistakes I am not a native speaker. I want to play a PVP focused game on XBOX one, wich one should I play? Neverwinter or Path of Exile ? Is there another one? I want a free PVP game, I don't want to be penalized because I PK someone. Hi I'm Matt, looking for people to play the above games with mostly and some other stuff that's on my steam library. I 'm really into Apex Legends lately, wouldn't say i'm amazing but i'm not terrible, I don't really take it too seriously and just want to have fun, winning is nice but not what I aim for all the time. The main game I play is Black Desert. I'll also play basically anything on my steam library. Here's my steam: (http://steamcommunity.c.
