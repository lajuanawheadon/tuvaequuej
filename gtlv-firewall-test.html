· Здравствуйте, друзья! В этом видео я расскажу о том, как обезопасить свой компьютер, планшет, smart TV и прочие. So I am currently running an adventure/scenario arc where half of my party joins Firewall as Sentinels, and because the campaign is largely limited to the Outer System, I intend to have Firewall test their teamwork and Sentinel capabilities by having them have a surprise mission on Earth via hidden darkcasting capabilities. Ostensibly they will be told that they are supposed to recover some data archive (something lost in the Infopocalypse of the Fall) but in reality their Proxy wants Not PCI, not HIPPA, nothing like that. Just a simple sales tool that can scan small networks like 25 computers or less, provide a quick inventory, missing patches, maybe a quick firewall test, maybe checks for whole disk encryption is computers, hopefully supports peer-to-peer networks (even if it means a quick agent install on each pc), basically small tests that I could do myself in a couple of hours onsite but instead a tool that can do it in 15m and generate a pretty. Installed: PIA v82 / MacOS 10.11.6 / Vuze 5.7.6.0 / java 1.6.0\_65 / ruby 2.0.0p648 / Little Snitch 4.0.5 Primary issue: no remote seeders. Recently bought a PIA subscription. Its been working reasonably for a few weeks. With robust multiple-seeder torrents, I have no problem (since the local connections suffice). However, with torrents of 3-5 seeders, those remote connections really matter. (So, the underlying issue is a failure of port forwarding? I do have the red "Firewalled" status We use DirectAccess on Server 2012. We have a mix of Windows 7 and 10 Enterprise clients. Up until recently they both connected in fine.

My boss and I were discussing this today. Given the amount of scripts/daily trouble shooting and failover tests use it, how screwed would the IT world be if Google suddenly decided to block ICMP to 8.8.8.8 (https://8.8.8.8). I always wondered how much ICMP traffic hits that address everyday. I have ZoneAlarm as my firewall, and have Windows 7. I noticed yesterday that in the start field of Windows, ZoneAlarm has changed icon, and when I hold my mouse on it, it says that "a security update is in progress", instead of the usual "your computer is protected". It has been like that all the time this evening as well, yet I can't see any evidence that it is updating or downloading anything. I did run an online firewall test, and it seems to be alright though. First off, I'm aware of the adage "Everyone has a test network. Some people are lucky enough to have a production network." For the purposes of this post, assume that when I say "test network", I do NOT mean your production network. So, do you have a test network? If so, what does it look like? - Do you have a couple of spare random switches and routers laying around you can use to test new features, while connected to your production network? - Do you have one of each type of device Howdy, /r/sysadmin!

Hey, I'm working in a dev role where they have some resources that are not available in some regions of China/Russia, due to their government firewalls. I wanted to create a local web-page developers could run, where they can click 'Test from China' and the page run a test remotely in China to see if it could access the resource (preferably from several locations, such as Shanghai, Hong Kong etc).I know there's a page I can test from ( https://www.websitepulse.com/tools/china-firewall-test. I've set up a few clients with 3CX deployments but the one using a USG has been problematic configuring it so there is full cone (1 to 1) NAT on the required ports including 5060, 5090 and the RTP port range. It works, but it fails the firewall test complaining that it fails full cone NAT tests. The issue with failing the test is it is a requirement for it to pass the firewall test for 3CX to provide any technical support. Has anyone successfully set up 3CX behind 
Is it possible to setup a physical firewall to my error. This is going to require some explaining, so I'll try to explain everything we've gathered about the problem. It all started when we were playing on a realm (Mojang Minecraft realms) and after the update from 1.12.2 to 1.13 it wasn't possible to play anymore (just got an error or a crash whenever we connected to the realm). So I got the realm owner to send me the gamefiles and I tried to open it in Single Player. When I opened it in SP in 1.13 the game just crashed. So I tried opening I thought up this scenario to try and really grok the SR5 Matrix rules as-written. They aren't as bad as people say, but there are a few ambiguities.
